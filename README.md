Full-Stack project completed entirely within Java. 
Uses SQL and basic database knowledge to host a friendly game of battleship that requires 1-2 players with an option to compete against a computer-player if you have no friends.
In the future, this will be able to run on two machines with the ability to "chat" to one another.

There is a "gui branch" which is a version of this game that permits the use of a GUI instead of having to play the game in the console. Currently just a mock-up. This project will be complete by the end of April, 2024.
